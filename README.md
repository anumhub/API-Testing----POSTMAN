# API Testing
 Basics of Testing :

client server communication :
Client - when fill URL(www.google.com) in browser (Chrome,Firefox,Egde)- the page request is sent to web server through internet
Server - web server(actual software application) send response to client(desktop,laptop,mobile)


API- Application programming interface - to communicate 2 different applications

Types of API 

1. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)- old 
2. Representational State Transfer(REST)- used in companies  -->  These are both Web Services

   API Vs Web Services

   when API are developed and tested and then goes to production using internet - that is web services
   No network connection is needed for API testing | Web Services need network connection 
   

   All API's are not webservices
   All web services are API's

   API Testing Tool 

   Postman tool for manual testing
